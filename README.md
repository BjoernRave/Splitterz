# Splitterz

Repo for my Unity game Splitterz for Android

written with C#

Be aware, that this was my first real programming project and I started to learn it by just starting and doing it.

I only upload it here to have a backup and to show my past experience with C#, to build the actual game you would also need the Unity environment and the assets and everything
